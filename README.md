## Better Statistics Screen

This Minecraft mod replaces the Vanilla statistics screen with an new and improved statistics screen that is easier to use and that has more helpful features. The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.
 
### As of v2.6, the mod can optionally be installed on the server side for some extra features:
- Improving the "betterstats hud" feature by making it more real-time and more accurate.
(v2.7+) Adding a feature that allows players to see each other's statistics.
- Keep in mind that this is optional, and the mod does not have to be installed on the server side in order to work.

If you experience any issues or server crashes when attempting to install this mod on a server, please try installing **"Fabric API"**, **"Architectury API"**, and maybe **"TCDCommons API"** as well, and see if that fixes the issue. Idk, for some reason Fabric server refuses to load those embedded libraries, all the while it works just fine on the client. So I guess install those on the server as well if you get any crashes.

### Credits (regarding the video)
I decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.
