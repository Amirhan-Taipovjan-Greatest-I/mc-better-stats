## Better Statistics Screen

This Minecraft mod replaces the Vanilla statistics screen with an new and improved statistics screen that is easier to use and that has more helpful features. The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.

### Credits (regarding the video)
I decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.
